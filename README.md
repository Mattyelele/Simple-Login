## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository includes the source code to a simple login form in C#. I'm currently making this to build on my C# skills and I'm currently learning about databases in college so I wanna build on my knowledge about them.

## 🔧 Plans <a name = "plans"></a>

I wanna add a register feature and permissions so only some users can access certain features.
